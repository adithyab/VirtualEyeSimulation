# VirtualEyeSimulation
Modeling Visual System in Virtual Environment with High Realism to Human Eye in Correlation with Head Movement
Raw_Data [FOLDER]
Containts three sub folders
  1. Eye Tracker Data
    -> eye_tracker_exported_data
    containts data exported from the pupil-lab eye tracker for all the 6 scenarios descibed in the article
    -> marker_data
    containts data pertaing to the movement of markers for the 3 moving head scenarios
  2. Simulation_Video
  containts videos of simulation videos of simualtion with and with vestibular reflexes
  3. test(s→a,b)
    -> marker_data(s→a,b,test)
    Containts the data pertining to the movement of markers
    -> s-a-fast-rtlb
    contanins data pertining to experiments conducted for speed,direction and distance
    ->s-a-slow-tb
    contanins data pertining to experiments conducted for speed,direction and distance
    
IT MUST BE NOTED THAT THE DATA AVAILBLE HERE IS SUBSET OF THE RAW DATA EXPORTED FROM THE EYE TRACKER. THE DATA HOWEVER IS NOT DIRECTLY PRESENTED IN THE RESEARCH ARTICLE.
